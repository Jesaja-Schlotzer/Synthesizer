# Synthesizer

With this project I am trying to explore the field of sound synthesis. 

The three "Module" classes in the audio.modules package are a good showcase of the currently possible functions.

To completely understand the code I would recommend to have basic understanding of audio synthesis.
An article I can recomment for this purpose is this one (https://reverb.com/news/intro-to-synthesis-our-6-part-video-series-on-synth-basics).
